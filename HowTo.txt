'g1_exo_doFit_class.py' is the original version
'g1_exo_doFit_class_without_data.py' is changed with no data in signal region (and some changes for the plots)


code is working in CMSSW_5_3_32, not compatible with ROOT 6 !


to run the code, use

	python g1_exo_doFit_class_without_data.py -b -c el --mass 800 --category HPW --sample BulkG_WW_lvjj --jetalgo Mjpruned

'-c el' is the channel, you have to run both '-c el' and '-c mu'
'--mass 800' is the mass of the resonance, so it's irrelevant
'--cateogry HPW' sets the category, HP for High Purity and W for WW-category
'--sample BulkG_WW_lvjj' sets the signal sample, also irrelevant
